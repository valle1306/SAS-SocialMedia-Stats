# 📊 Social Media Usage Analysis with SAS

This project explores the relationship between **age** and **time spent on social media** using a synthetic dataset. All analysis was conducted in **SAS** and includes a variety of statistical methods and visualizations.

## 📁 Project Overview

The goal is to evaluate how age groups differ in social media usage patterns. We used a dataset with variables such as age, time spent on social media (in hours), gender, platform type, and more.

## 🔧 Methods Used

- `PROC MEANS` – summary statistics  
- `PROC FREQ` – frequency and cross-tabulations  
- `PROC UNIVARIATE` – distribution analysis  
- `PROC CORR` – correlation coefficients  
- `PROC TTEST` – one-sample and two-sample t-tests  
- `PROC ANOVA` – mean comparison across age groups  
- `PROC REG` – linear regression  
- `PROC TABULATE`, `PROC SGPLOT` – data visualization  

## 📈 Key Findings

- No significant correlation found between age and time spent on social media.
- Regression and ANOVA showed minimal explanatory power (R² ~ 0.0067).
- Visualizations supported statistical findings with weak age-based trends.

## 📌 Limitations

- Data is synthetically generated for educational use and not from real human respondents.
- Small sample size (n = 30) limits statistical power.
- No adjustment for potential confounders like socioeconomic status or education.

## 📚 Tools

- Language: SAS  
- Environment: SAS Studio  
- Dataset Source: [Kaggle – synthetic dataset]  

This project strengthened skills in SAS programming, statistical analysis, and interpreting results with practical limitations in mind. It also highlighted the importance of data source validity in drawing meaningful conclusions.
